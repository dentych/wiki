This is a personal documentation site, with documentation relevant mainly for myself.

I write documentation about various things here, in order to remember how things are done and how things are setup.

In the left-hand side is a navigation menu, which lists all information available on this wiki. Some of the bold items 
in the list can be clicked, but some can't. The ones that can't simply means there is no information in the top most
section, but only in the subsections. Hover over the links to see if they become underlined. Links that are underlined
contains text.

The wiki is a static website made with {{<newtablink "https://gohugo.io" "Hugo">}}, built with Gitlab CI and deployed 
to Gitlab Pages.

# What can you find on this wiki?

Currently, there is only a little bit of documentation regarding k3s, which is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution.

I have set it up for myself, and it works great. See [k3s](k3s)
